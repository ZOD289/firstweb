Dodge the Blocks — minimal instructions

Files:
- `dodge the blocks.php` — original file (HTML inside .php)
- `dodge-the-blocks.html` — standalone HTML copy for easy opening

How to run / open

- Open directly (double-click):
  - In File Explorer, double-click `dodge-the-blocks.html` to open in your default browser.
  - Or from PowerShell:
    Start-Process 'd:\21-ITE-08\dodge-the-blocks.html'

- Serve locally (recommended for consistent behavior):
  - If you have PHP installed (serves PHP and files):
    Set-Location 'd:\21-ITE-08'; php -S localhost:8000;
    Then open: http://localhost:8000/dodge-the-blocks.html

  - If you have Python installed (static files):
    Set-Location 'd:\21-ITE-08'; python -m http.server 8000;
    Then open: http://localhost:8000/dodge-the-blocks.html

Notes / next steps
- I can add touch controls, sound, difficulty settings, or mobile UI if you want.
- I can also create a zip or a packaged build for distribution.
